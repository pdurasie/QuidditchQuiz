# QuidditchQuiz
This app tests your knowledge on the rules of the Quidditch sport.

# Features

- 10 difficult, non-standard questions
- Multiple types of questions (Multiple choice, several correct answers, textbased answers)
- Answers are evaluated and users recieve visual and text based feedback on their performance

# Future outlook for this app
There is a potential need for an mobile application that helps aspiring and experienced referees alike expand their knowledge on the Quidditch ruleset. The existing system for referee tests has no mobile implementation and could be integrated to allow an easier entry for qualified referees. The potential market is therefore worldwide.

# TODO 
- Add larger pool of questions
- Randomize block of questions for one user session
- Connect to a database holding existing questions for current referee tests
- Integrate lists of certified referees worldwide


# License
Standard licensing laws apply.
